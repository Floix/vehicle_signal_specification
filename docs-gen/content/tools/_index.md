# Tools

A released specification can be used, together with tools in
this repository, to automatically generate a number of different
target specification formats, such as JSON, FrancaIDL, etc.

Fig 1 shows the schematics of the top-level process.

The tools are available under the ```tools``` directory.

The release management process will be driven in the context of GENIVI
and its Remote Vehicle Interaction expert group.
